Piano Pracitce App/Rhythm Game
  Application built in C++. Allows users to practice piano playing by displaying actual musical notes (both stationary and scrolling, similar to other rhythm games) and accepting MIDI input. Supports import of MIDI files to populate new tracks for practice.

Features
  Actual music-theory based approach to rhythm gaming; rather than simple symbols and colors, a grand staff and notes are used.
  Support for digital keyboards as MIDI input devices.
  Stationary note-matching mode.
  Live playing mode where notes will scroll to the left on the staff and players will need to hit the notes at the correct time (designated by a marking on the staff).
  Accepts MIDI file import to populate new pieces of music to be played/practiced.
